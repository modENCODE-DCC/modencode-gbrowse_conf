 <h1>RNAi Control (untreated) in S2-DRSC RNA-Seq (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)</h1>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells.  From this collection of regulated exons, we will identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein.  To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome.  Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

   RNAi CG33106 in S2-DRSC RNA-seq uniquely mapping reads 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain</i> (<i>mask</i>, CG33106). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>small ribonucleoprotein particle U1 subunit 70K</i> (<i>snRNP-U1-70K</i>, CG8749). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>Fmr1</i> (CG6203). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

   RNAi CG13425 in S2-DRSC RNA-seq uniquely mapping reads 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>bancal</i> (<i>bl</i>, CG13425). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells.  From this collection of regulated exons, we will identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein.  To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome.  Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting CG31716. Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>quaking related 54B</i> (<i>qkr54b</i>, CG4816). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting boule (CG4760). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>rasputin</i> (CG9412). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting SC35 (CG5442). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>embryonic lethal abnormal vision</i> (<i>elav</i>, CG4262). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 RNA-seq analysis was performed on biological replicates of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2-DRSC cells treated with dsRNA targeting <i>yu</i> (CG3249). Uniquely aligned reads were mapped using Bowtie. Tracks show alignments and read density.
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. From this collection of regulated exons, we will attempt to identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome. Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events.

 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG10128, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.

 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

   RIP-seq D.mel splicing factor CG10203 TopHat alignment r5 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG10203, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.
 Tracks show unique read alignments and density<br/>
 Total read count: 67287662<br />
 Mapped read count: 12214463<br />
 Alignment rate: 18%<br /> 
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

   RIP-seq D.mel splicing factor CG6203 TopHat alignment r5 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG6203, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.

 Total read count: 316765991<br />
 Mapped read count: 43211477<br />
 Alignment rate: 13%<br /> 
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

   RIP-seq D.mel splicing factor CG10851 TopHat alignment r5 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG10851, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.
 Tracks show unique read alignments and density<br/>
 Total read count: 87185535<br />
 Mapped read count: 18336315<br />
 Alignment rate: 21%<br /> 
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

   RIP-seq D.mel splicing factor CG5442 TopHat alignment r5 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG5442, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.
 Tracks show unique read alignments and density<br/>
 Total read count: 84088099<br />
 Mapped read count: 14191281<br />
 Alignment rate: 16%<br /> 
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

   RIP-seq D.mel splicing factor CG16725 TopHat alignment r5 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG16725, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.
 Tracks show unique read alignments and density<br/>
 Total read count: 311149790<br />
 Mapped read count: 39798687<br />
 Alignment rate: 12%<br /> 
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.

   RIP-seq D.mel splicing factor CG9998 TopHat alignment r5 
   (Celniker project, Graveley subgroup)
 </h1>
 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>Reads were sequenced from Drosophila melanogaster RNA libraries made from S2R+ cells transformed with CG9998, and aligned with TopHat against the r5 genome.  Because the samples are IPs of total cell lysates, which most likely include a high fraction of rRNA, and only unique alignments were retained, the alignment rates appear artificially low.
 Tracks show unique read alignments and density<br/>
 Total read count: 104678288<br />
 Mapped read count: 14395489<br />
 Alignment rate: 13%<br /> 
 </p>
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The goal of these experiments is to identify RNAs bound by individual RNA-binding proteins. Drosophila S2R+ cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated HA-tagged RNA-binding proteins, or without an insert as a control. Expression was induced with CuSO4, whole cell lysates were prepared and protein-RNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA immunoaffinity resin. RNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitated material, and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina Tru-Seq mRNA kits and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq2000. Sequence reads were aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome r5 using TopHat and expression levels were quantitated using Cufflinks.
