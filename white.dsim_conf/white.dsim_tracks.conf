   D.sim_E0-4h_Kr 
   (White project, White subgroup)
 </h1>
 Nuclei were isolated from staged D. simulans embryos 0-4 hr after egg laying, and cross-linked with formaldehyde.  After lysis and sonication the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified antibodies recognizing the zinc-finger gap protein, Kruppel.  The DNA was sequenced on the Illumina platform (Input DNA from a mock IP was sequenced in parallel).  The signal intensity (or wiggle file) data track shows normalized data from two experimental replicates.  For ChIP-seq called peaks, the MACS algorithm was used to predict binding peaks in normalized data from both experimental replicates.  <br/> <br/> 
 <h2>General Description</h2>
 <p>
 The White Lab is aiming to map the association of all the Transcription Factors (TF) and DNA associated proteins on the genome of Drosophila simulans. The main technique that will be used for this purpose is chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) utilizing whole-genome tiling arrays. The data generated by ChIP-chip experiments consist basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested TF.<br/>
 ChIP-seq, meaning direct sequencing of the ChIP sample on the Solexa platform, has also been used to validate some datasets and will become- as the project advances- the main production platform.<br/>
 <br/>
 To support ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq datasets, and in order to link association of factors to the DNA with regulation of transcription, several RNA-seq (direct sequencing of the transcriptome on the Solexa platform) datasets will be genrated for the time-points under scrutiny.
